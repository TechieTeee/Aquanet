## What it does
Aquanet allows users to get real-time water quality updates through real time and transparent data on FEVM.


## Inspiration
In September of 2022, Jackson, Mississippi, a modern American city experienced a water quality crisis that prevented its more than 150,000 residents from doing regular, daily activities like bathing, brushing their teeth, and cooking. To date, in November 2022, the water quality issue in Jackson, Mississippi has yet to be resolved. Unfortunately, this is not the only community that has been impacted by similar water quality issues, such as Flint, Michigan, the Navajo Nation, and numerous communities around the world. So I was inspired to change this issue by putting the power back in the hands of everyday people with verifiable water quality on-chain.
